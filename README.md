# Features
- Stuck in a car
- The car dies, you die; Leaving behind a corpse, but the car's contents is gone
- Automatically add some fake "wood" fuel to the car when there is none in it but make the car much slower
- When out of fuel (so using fake fuel) show an out of fuel icon
- Support switching in and out of editor mode but it deletes all of the car's contents (for now?)
- Support freeplay cutscene
- Using fish heals the car
- Holding repair packs and hovering (selecting) entities will automatically use the repair packs to repair
  (because you can't use repair packs in cars, period)
- Give the car natural health regen (with a delay just as if you were a character)

# Todo
- Suicide button
  - Randomize respawn location a bit just in case the spawn location it picks actually gets you stuck
