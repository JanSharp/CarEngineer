# Features
- Stuck in a car
- The car dies, you die; Leaving behind a corpse, but the car's contents is gone
- Automatically add some fake "wood" fuel to the car when there is none in it but make the car much slower
- Support switching in and out of editor mode but it deletes all of the car's contents (for now?)
- Support freeplay cutscene

# Possible future features
- Suicide button
- Randomize respawn location a bit just in case the spawn location it picks actually gets you stuck
- Automactially repair entities when holding repair packs and selecting ("hovering") an entity because repairing just doesn't work
- Use a car that has either a tiny inventory or none
  - Or automatically move all contents of the car to the player inventory or if it's full spill it on the ground
